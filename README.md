Mock up


## **User Stories** ##

### **First Time Visitor Goals** ###

1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to see what the game is.
2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to see if I can pick it up easily.
3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to see if I can complete the task.

### **Returning Visitor Goals** ###

1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to see if I can finish the game quicker.
2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to see if other levels of difficulty have been added.


>## **Features** ##

The game board is brightly coloured and visually pleasing. The images of the the matching pairs are quite similar\
to each other in some cases to make the game more difficult. The images also have alt attributes so if the images do not\
display, the game can still be played.

### **Furture Features** ###

Many more levels could be added to the game with more matches to find.\
The images could be even more similar to each other to add to difficulty\
A countdown timer element could be added for more difficulty.\
A scoreboard could be created for returning users.\

>## **Technologies Used** ##

To create this site, the following have been used.\
GitPod <https://www.gitpod.io/> and GitHub <https://github.com/> were used to create, host, store and \
eventually deploy the project.\
Bootstrap <https://getbootstrap.com/> was used for layout and resposive elements of the site. \
Pexels <https://www.pexels.com/> was used for all the images throughout the site\
W3C <https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/> , W3C <https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input> and \
were used JSHint <https://jshint.com/>for testing purposes along with Lighthouse in developer tools\

>## **Testing** ##

## **First Time Visitor Goals** ##

1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to see what the game is.

+ On first loading the site, a simple line of text explains what the game is about.

2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to see if I can pick it up easily.

+ After reading the basic instrustions, and two cards being clicked on, an alert appears with either a yes or no comment,\
with more relevant wording relating to the game. One the ok button is clicked, the game can carry on.

3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to see if I can complete the task.

+ Once started, the urge to finish the game is too great to just leave it, so completing it is a must.


## **Returning Visitor Goals** ##

1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to see if I can finish the game quicker.

+ Until a possible coutdown is added, competition against yourself and previous times is a big incentive to try again.

2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to see if other levels of difficulty have been added.

+ A number of additions can be made to the game including more levels, to draw users in.




I have run the code including css through W3C validators and checkers and no errors have occurred.

### **Content** ###

All text written by the developer except the biography, which is loosely based on two \
biographies from theatre programmes found on the show websites, (Phantom and Les Mis), \
which I have then altered to create a new piece.\
The Code Institute Sample README has been a massive help with writing my own.\
The <w3cschools.com> webite has also been invaluable with.
